# Interview of C++

### Function signature

Without parameter names, like this:

```c++
int foo(char*);
```



A function's **signature** includes the function's name and the number, order and type of its formal parameters.

Two overloaded functions must not have the same signature

The return value is **not** part of a function's signature

These two functions have the same signature

```c++
int Divide (int n, int m) ;
double Divide (int n, int m) ;
```
